Insights from Pipestitch, RipTide, and REVAMP

This survey paper examines three significant advancements in the field of energy-efficient dataflow architectures: Pipestitch, RipTide, and Heterogeneous CGRA Realization. Pipestitch is designed to enhance performance in sparse workloads while keeping energy consumption low by introducing lightweight hardware threads and a novel synchronization network. RipTide, a programmable energy-minimal dataflow compiler and architecture, excels in energy efficiency by offloading entire computational kernels onto the CGRA fabric but faces performance challenges in sparse applications. Heterogeneous CGRA Realization integrates diverse processing elements within the CGRA framework, balancing flexibility, performance, and energy efficiency, making it suitable for complex and sparse computations. This survey discusses the key findings, methodologies, and implications for future research.
